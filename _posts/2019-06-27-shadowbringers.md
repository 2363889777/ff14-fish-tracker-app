title: Shadowbringers Update is Live
---

New fish have been added to the site for Shadowbringers. Keep in mind, because
I cannot render multiple locations for fish, I've used whatever the fishing
hole identified by the fishing log book. Also, some fish may have time and
weather conditions which are still unknown. Enjoy the main story, then kick
back and go fish!

You can expect some of these fish to mysteriously vanish as they are ruled out
as having conditions for catching.
