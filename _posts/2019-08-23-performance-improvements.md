title: Site Performance Rework Complete
---

Display code rework is finally complete. The site should be a lot more
responsive and it will now remember your filter settings for when you come
back. Patch filters are not saved at this time, sorry.

Spearfishing nodes are still on the way and will be rolled up into another
large rework effort. Upcoming features include: filtering out fish that are
always up, filtering by importance (collectable, scrip, quest, crafting, etc.),
and much more!
